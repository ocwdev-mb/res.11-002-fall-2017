In this video, Carpenter introduces his theory of disruption and explains how his work combines art practice, art education, and social practice. He explores ideas of access and how people can create “something from nothing” using the example of his work on low-cost ceramic water filters with underserved communities in south Texas. This video will be of interest to art educators, socially-engaged artists, and those with an interest in access to clean water.
