Carpenter introduces curriculum theory and discusses the movement away from art as materials-based practice to art as engagement with the world. This type of art lends itself to disruptive practice and transformative learning. This session will be particularly interesting to art educators as they navigate how to include elements learned throughout Carpenter’s lecture series into their classrooms.
