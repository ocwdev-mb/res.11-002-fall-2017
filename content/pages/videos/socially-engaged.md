In this video, Carpenter explains the concepts of double taking and troublemaking through his project on double water fountains. Susskind and Carpenter also engage in conversation about how art can be used to instigate conversations about race. This video will be stimulating for those interested in socially engaged art and art’s ability to open difficult conversations.
